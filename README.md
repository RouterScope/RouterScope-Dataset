# RouterScope-Dataset

## Description

This is the Internet router geolocation dataset produced by NSDI 25's submission, "RouterScope: Achieving Robust and Accurate Internet Router Geolocation with Probabilistic Neighbor Models".

For each router in the dataset, we present its geographic coordinates and location information, and provide its interface IP address list and complete router-level topology.

## Availability

Due to the consideration of protecting our research, we will not disclose this dataset at present.

Once we enter the subsequent review stage, we will publish the dataset in a timely manner :)
